Project Details
---------------
 A file management system developed using .Net Core Web API and Angular 14.

 The VS solution file contains five projects, and the user interface project can be located in 'file-management-ui' folder.

 A local sql server database using windows auth is used to support and store data in regards to the file upload service.
 The connection string of a local database is included in the appsettings.json file. 
 Migrations have been implemented and the files are included under the FileManagement.Infrastructure project. 
 Simply update-database using migrations and local db server, or change the connection string.
 Unit tests have been implemented and tested using xUnit.

 Node modules have been removed from the angular project.
 Install packages from package.json using default npm install command. 
 Unit tests have been implemented and tested using Karma to run Jasmine tests.

 The file management system validates file size, file type, and duplicate files as well.
